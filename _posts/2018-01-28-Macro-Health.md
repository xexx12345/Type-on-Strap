Jekyll supports the use of [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) with inline HTML tags which makes it easier to quickly write posts with Jekyll, without having to worry too much about text formatting. A sample of the formatting follows.

Unemployment Rate Rising > 4.6
National Financial Conditions (US Leverage) > 0.0
Yield Spread > 2
Industrial Production Consumer Goods Month Over Month Decline for 3 Consecutive Months
Real Retail and Services Month Over Month Decline for 3 Consecutive Months
New Housing Starts Month Over Month Decline for 3 Consecutive Months
China Confidence Index Last Month Decline < -3%
The current levels of these indicators are as follows:

Tables have also been extended from Markdown:

First Header  | Second Header
------------- | -------------
Content Cell  | Content Cell
Content Cell  | Content Cell
