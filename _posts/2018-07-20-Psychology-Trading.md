> Though this removal from the literal value of money could certainly be a hazard in real life, it is an excellent habit for removing an emotional element from the trading day. The moment you lose sight of money as a tool of the game and revert to
thinking of it in terms of its purchasing power, you have sentenced yourself to playing less skillfully and more emotionally, which is poison to any trader

> Follow your plan and follow your word, and your trading skills will increase

> The biggest issue for newer traders is to reprogram their brains into realizing that in trading, losing is winning. A professional trader’s job is to take small losses. Period. Most traders don’t realize that there are only a few days each month where big profits can be made. The rest of the time, traders are doing their job if they are keeping their heads above water.

> When traders decide that they don’t want to lose any more money, they unwittingly turn themselves into the “late entry” champions of the trading world. They wait and they wait and they make doubly sure that a trade looks good before they take it. In this scenario, the markets start to rally, but by the time the trader is absolutely convinced that this rally is for real, she is jumping in near the dead highs of the move. She and the rest of the traders who did this just gave the markets the fuel they needed to start moving down. Why? Because suddenly the market has a lot of stops being placed beneath it, and like wind on a forest fire, these stops will ignite a sell-off. This safe, cautious entry quickly turns into a loss.
